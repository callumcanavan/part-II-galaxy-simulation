# part-II-galaxy-simulation

Code used for my computational physics project, "Simulating the Tidal Tails of Interacting Galaxies". This uses stepwise integration of Newtonian gravity to simulate the formation of the tidal tails which occur in [real galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_tail). The stars are modelled to be in circular orbit around the black hole of one galaxy and interact gravitationally with the black hole of another in parabolic orbit. The formation of tidal tails due to the perturbation of the stars' orbits is then investigated for various changing parameteres in 2 and 3 dimensions. 

The whole project can be viewed in the Jupyter notebook while individual parts can be found in different .py files. Below are sample snapshots of galaxies interacting in 2D and in 3D.
